<h1>
Tech Exercises!
</h1>

<h2>
Please note!
</h2>

<p>
Folders for previous tech exercises may be accessed from the top level directory. In order to execute a certain springboot exercise one must copy the relevant folder to: /src/main/java/
</p>
<p>
It is important that this folder only has one main class at a time otherwise springboot will throw an error. This can be achieved by moving any unrelated folder out of the directory prior to issuing springboot commands.
</p>
<p>
If problems persist you may need to clean your spring-boot package configuration with maven. You can do this by issuing this command:
</p>

<pre>
mvn clean package spring-boot:repackage 
</pre>

<h2>
Part 2: HelloWorld
</h2>

<p>
In order to run springboot issue:
</p>

<pre>
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</pre>

<p>
In order to run the groovy app issue:
</p>

<pre>
spring run app.groovy
</pre>
